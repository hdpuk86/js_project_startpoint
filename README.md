# Space Oddity
An educational interactive web app about the solar system, created using core Javascript. A group project built using agile working practices.

# The Spec:

## Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way. 

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content

## Approach

The project was planned out using some UX design techniques; creating user profiles and mapping user journeys. We used these profiles to draw up our acceptance criteria, wireframes and MOSCOW board and then put together a class diagram and integration diagrams to work from.

We worked using agile methods such as sprints, daily stand-ups and a kanban board. We worked really effectively as a team. We mob programmed on day 1 to get our initial server and database up and running using teletype in atom worked really well for this. There were also a few features that were pair-programmed later on. Our main working system for the project was to take the next ticket off the top of our kanban board but if there was something specific someone wanted to do we would agree during our morning stand up. Our stand ups normally discussed our goals for the day, adding new tickets to the board and clearing up any confusions. We also made good use of slack when working from home to keep informed and offer help with problems. 

We built our own API using MongoDB to store the information we needed and we used Mocha and Selenium for our testing.

## Outcome

Our final product enables users to explore the solar system. From the home view they can click on a planet to display more information, take quizzes and track their learning progress. We also created an adventure view which shows the solar system to scale and allows users to journey through it. Adventure mode comes complete with an accurate distance meter, rocket ships and music for the trip. We also hid fun easter eggs around the site for more inquisitive users to find.
